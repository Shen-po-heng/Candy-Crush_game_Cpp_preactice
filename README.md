# Candy Crush_game_Cpp_preactice_
Hello, Every one, this candy crush by C is created at 2015 when I was fresh man. 

Although if let myself judge this program, there is too many place I can adjust it now, like repetitive code and not concise.
But, it's a memory for me.Maybe when I have time, I'd come back here to adjust it.

Welcome for fun.
